## Learnings
#### tools
	- A11y in chrome dev tools gives the accessible DOM tree
	- chrome lighthouse (doesn't give ful analysis)
	- jaws (paid), or use system screen readers with eyes closed
	- use `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` (similar for html etc)
	- proper contrast ratio for better visual UX (available in dev tools colour picker)
	- WCAG AA & AAA test pass (extension)
#### tips
	- use correct HTML semantics like `nav`, `aside`
	- a page should have only 1 `h1` tag
	- use html tags like main, aside, article, button. Not everything should be a div.
	- buttons etc are automatically tab focusable
	- *focus order* - write correct order of HTML, so that DOM order handles it
	- else tabbing will jump focus wrongly on screen
	- `autofocus` attribute - automatically focused on page reload (eg: google's search box)
	- use proper HTML for focus, but if manual intervention needed, use *tabIndex*
		- tabIndex = 0
			- makes any element focusable
			- also programmatically by JS's focus()
		- tabIndex = -1
			- not in tab order, but focusable
				- if we want to direct user to specific space
		- tabIndex > 0
			- avoid it, its an anti-pattern, screenreader order reads doesn't jump based on it
			- to jump ahead than the natural tab order, eg: 3 -> 4 -> 5
	- *aria-labels* - we shouldn't use heavily, right HTML will handle it correctly
		- but if needed, we've them
		- giving role (like button or tab etc) to non semantic elements, for screen readers
		- `aria-labelledby` - labelled by another element with that id (like label for & input id)
		- `aria-label` - adding a label for screen readers
#### inert property for hidden components like side nav content, modal content
	- thats essentially does tabIndex = -1 for all the children not on screen
	- attributes like `aria-hidden=true`, `role=dialog`, `aria-modal=true` handle inertness automatically
## visual a11y (chrome dev tools -> rendering -> emulate visual deficiencies)
	- blur (even with low/blurry vision, text content might be blur but hierarchy should make sense)
	- contrast (all text colours should be readable)
	- grayscale (site should make sense)
	- tips
		- label's `for` attribute should match input's `id` attribute
		- `aria-live` for toast components showing any feedback
		- alt tag on image
		- semantics
## keyboard a11y
	- every actionable item should be tab focusable
	- if you do `outline: none` on button for styling, add the outline/border on `button:focus-visible`
	- skip link - to skip the long navbar
## screen readers
	- on a blog page, if an article's heading is clickable & screen readable, the read more button shouldn't be screen readable as for each article, user will have to tab twice, rather once
	- proper DOM hierarchy (h1, h2 etc)
## audio impairments
	- check your site is usable with sound off
	- captions enabled for videos
## mobility impaired
	- spacing between actionable items should be enough so that old people or anyone shouldn't click wrong this accidentally
	- button size should be not too small
		- for checkboxes, labels should be clickable
	- don't have too short timing restrictions to click something, coz some people might have hard time navigating to it
## css emulators for user preferences
	- add the required media queries for user preferences like colour mode or reduce motions
## mobile responsiveness
