Topological sort is a fundamental graph-theoretic tool for imposing a linear ordering on the vertices of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) so that every directed edge `u → v` has `u` before `v` in the order. At its heart lies the concept of in‑degree—the count of incoming edges per vertex—which lets us iteratively peel off vertices with no unmet dependencies.

DAGs capture partial orders—not every pair of vertices is comparable—a topological sort extends them to a total (linear) order consistent with the original dependencies.

## Real world examples
- **Task Scheduling**: If certain jobs must finish before others start (e.g., wash clothes before drying), a topological ordering yields a valid execution sequence.
- **Build Systems & Makefiles**: Compiling modules with interdependencies follows the same pattern—compile dependencies first.
- **Data Serialization & Database Loading**: Loading tables with foreign-key constraints requires parents before children.
- **Project Management (PERT/CPM)**: Milestones and tasks form a DAG whose topological sort helps find the critical path.

## Linear Ordering Need
A partial order defines “must come before” constraints but leaves some pairs unordered; a linear (total) order fully arranges all elements while respecting those constraints. In topological sort, we convert the partial order of the DAG into such a linear ordering—crucial for any problem where every element eventually needs placement in a single sequence.

## Core Logic (Intuition)
1. **Compute In-Degrees:** For each vertex, count how many edges point into it. This in-degree represents the number of unmet prerequisites.
2. **Initialize Queue of “Ready” Vertices:** Enqueue all vertices whose in-degree is 0—i.e., those with no prerequisites.
3. **Iteratively Peel Off Ready Vertices:**
    - Dequeue one vertex, append it to the ordering.
    - “Remove” it conceptually by decrementing the in-degree of all its outgoing neighbors.
    - Any neighbor whose in-degree drops to 0 becomes ready; enqueue it.
4. **Detect Cycles:** If the graph has a cycle, you'll exhaust the queue before including all vertices—signaling that no valid ordering exists.

This **BFS-style** approach (Kahn's algorithm) builds the linear order one “layer” at a time, always choosing vertices whose dependencies are already satisfied.

## Building Intuition Through Variation Examples

### Course Schedule Variant
- **Vertices:** Courses; **Edges:** Prerequisite relations (course A → course B means A before B).
- **Process:** Start with all courses having no prerequisites (in-degree 0) and then “unlock” dependent courses as you “take” each one. Visualizing the course graph and watching those in-degree counters drop helps cement the pattern.
```JS
function courseSchedule(num, preRequisites) {
    const depsGraph = new Map();
    const inDegree = new Array(num).fill(0);

    for(const [course, preReq] of preRequisites) {
        inDegree[course]++;
        if(!depsGraph.has(preReq)) {
            depsGraph.set(preReq, [course]);
        } else {
            depsGraph.set(preReq, [...depsGraph.get(preReq), course]);
        }
    }

    const queue = []
    for(let i=0; i<num; i++) {
        if(inDegree[i] === 0) {
            queue.push(i);
        }
    }

    const linearOrdering = []

    while(queue.length) {
        const course = queue.shift();
        linearOrdering.push(course);

        const neighbors = depsGraph.get(course) || [];
        for(const neighbor of neighbors) {
            inDegree[neighbor]--;
            if(inDegree[neighbor] === 0) queue.push(neighbor);
        }
    }

    return linearOrdering.length === num ? linearOrdering : [];
}

console.log(courseSchedule(4, [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]]))
console.log(courseSchedule(4, [[1, 0], [0, 1], [3, 1], [3, 2]]))
```

### Alien Dictionary Variant
- **Setup:** Given words sorted lexicographically in an unknown alphabet, infer the alphabet's order.
- **Step 1:** Compare each adjacent word pair to find the first differing character; add an edge from the earlier to the later character (e.g., if “ab” comes before “ac”, add edge b→c).
- **Step 2:** Apply topological sort on this character-graph. The resulting order is the inferred alphabet.
```JS
function extraterrestrialLanguage(words) {
  const adjList = {};
  const inDegree = {};

  // initialising
  for (const word of words) {
    for (const char of word) {
      if (!inDegree[char]) {
        inDegree[char] = 0;
        adjList[char] = [];
      }
    }
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {
    const word1 = words[i];
    const word2 = words[i + 1];

    if (word1.length > word2.length && word1.indexOf(word2) === 0) {
      return "";
    }

    for (let j = 0; j < Math.min(word1.length, word2.length); j++) {
      if (word1[j] !== word2[j]) {
        adjList[word1[j]].push(word2[j]);
        inDegree[word2[j]]++;
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  const linearOrdering = [],
    queue = [];

  for (const vertex in inDegree) {
    if (inDegree[vertex] === 0) {
      queue.push(vertex);
    }
  }

  while (queue.length) {
    const vertex = queue.shift();
    linearOrdering.push(vertex);

    for (const neighbor of adjList[vertex]) {
      inDegree[neighbor]--;
      if (inDegree[neighbor] === 0) {
        queue.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }

  if (linearOrdering.length < Object.keys(adjList).length) {
    return "";
  }

  return linearOrdering.join("");
}
```
